# Contributing to Adaptive Core (v2)

**Adaptive Core** is the *self-learning, cross-layer fusion engine* of the DigiByte Quantum Shield.  
It integrates signals from:

- DQSN v2 (network health)  
- Sentinel AI v2 (anomaly detection)  
- ADN v2 (defence tactics)  
- QWG (transaction behaviour analysis)  
- Guardian Wallet (user decisions)  

Adaptive Core builds **internal models**, **pattern memory**, and **dynamic rule updates**  
to strengthen future wallet and shield behaviour.

This is the **AI-like immune system** that evolves with threats.

Contributions must enhance:
- intelligence  
- safety  
- learning  
- pattern recognition  
- cross-layer signal fusion  

while keeping the architecture transparent and deterministic.

## ✅ What Contributions Are Welcome

### ✔️ 1. Signal Fusion Improvements
- better combination of multi-layer inputs  
- weighting, scoring, or confidence models  
- new fusion methods (rule-based, statistical, heuristic)

### ✔️ 2. Behavioural Pattern Memory
- long-term detection patterns  
- anomalous user-behaviour sequences  
- transaction habits modelling (non-invasive, anonymous)

### ✔️ 3. Adaptive Defence Logic
- smarter safe-mode triggers  
- dynamic sensitivity adjustments  
- context-aware defence decisions  

### ✔️ 4. Explainability Improvements
Add logic to ensure adaptive decisions are always:

- traceable  
- explainable  
- auditable  

### ✔️ 5. Test Improvements
- scenario simulations  
- fusion-path verification  
- behaviour-sequence tests  

### ✔️ 6. Documentation Enhancements
Clear explanations of:

- how adaptation works  
- how fusion occurs  
- safety philosophy

## ❌ What Will NOT Be Accepted

### 🚫 1. Opaque or Black-Box ML Models
Adaptive Core must *never* become:

- a neural network  
- an unexplainable AI system  
- a black-box prediction engine  

All behaviour must remain fully **transparent** and **deterministic**.

### 🚫 2. Removal of Core Layers
Adaptive Core depends on *all* shield inputs.  
Removing any integration path is not allowed.

### 🚫 3. Consensus or Node Behaviour Changes
Adaptive Core:

- cannot change consensus rules  
- cannot modify mempool logic  
- cannot influence network nodes  

Adaptation happens *inside the wallet ecosystem*, nowhere else.

### 🚫 4. Storing Sensitive User Data
No personal data, no behavioural tracking tied to identity.  
Only **anonymous behavioural patterns** are allowed.

### 🚫 5. Unbounded Learning
Adaptation must be:

- safe  
- reversible  
- controlled  
- predictable  

Not open-ended.

## 🧱 Design Principles

1. **Explainability**  
   Every adaptive decision must include a human-readable reason.

2. **Deterministic Learning**  
   If the same signals happen again, Adaptive Core responds the same way.

3. **Safety First**  
   Adaptation must increase security, not reduce it.

4. **Layer Awareness**  
   All shield signals are combined: DQSN → Sentinel → ADN → QWG → Guardian.

5. **Bounded Evolution**  
   No uncontrolled intelligence or unpredictable behaviour.

6. **Fail-Safe Defaults**  
   If uncertain → revert to safer mode.

7. **Minimalism**  
   No unnecessary complexity. Clear, modular, future-proof.
