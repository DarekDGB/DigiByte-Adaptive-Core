## 1. Purpose of the Adaptive Core
The Adaptive Core is the **immune system** of the entire DigiByte Quantum Shield architecture.  
While the 5 primary layers (Sentinel AI v2, DQSN v2, ADN v2, Guardian Wallet v2, QWG v2) provide detection, confirmation, defense, and wallet safety…  
**the Adaptive Core learns.**

It continuously:
- observes high‑risk patterns  
- stores threat memory  
- reinforces known signatures  
- evolves new signatures  
- sends immune alerts back to all layers  

This allows DigiByte to *get stronger after every attack*.

## 2. Core Components

### 🧠 2.1 Pattern Engine
Learns attack sequences, emerging anomalies, repeated patterns.

### 🗂 2.2 Threat Memory
Stores condensed “threat packets” describing previous high‑risk events.

### ✏️ 2.3 Memory Writer
Writes threat packets into long‑term memory and performs pruning rules.

### 🔌 2.4 Interface Layer
The external API for the other 5 layers to communicate with the Adaptive Core.

### ⚙️ 2.5 Engine
Coordinates memory, pattern logic, scoring and produces an **Immune Response Packet**.

## 3. What the Adaptive Core Learns

The system incrementally learns:

- UTXO cluster anomalies  
- Time‑compressed activity bursts  
- Dormant key sweeps  
- Multi‑layer correlated risk  
- Behavioural anomalies  
- Rare or new unseen attack sequences  
- Network‑level cross‑signals from DQSN  
- Node‑level reflex triggers from ADN  
- Wallet‑level behaviour changes (GW + QWG)

This produces a **Network Immune Score (NIS)** and an **Immune Severity Level**.

## 4. Data Flow

```
[Sentinel AI] →  
    signal packets (entropy drops, reorg patterns)
        ↓
[DQSN] →  
    global confirmation + cluster scoring
        ↓
[ADN v2] →  
    defensive events (lockdown, API throttling)
        ↓
[Wallet Layers] →  
    behavioural + quantum signatures
        ↓
[Adaptive Core] →  
    learn → store → evolve → return immune packet
```

Each loop makes the shield stronger.

## 5. Tests Included

The test suite covers every critical component:

- **test_deep_pattern_engine.py**  
- **test_engine.py**  
- **test_immune_report.py**  
- **test_interface_events.py**  
- **test_pattern_engine.py**  
- **test_threat_memory_limits.py**  

All tests are currently **passing** (CI green).

---

## 6. Reports Included

The Adaptive Core ships with detailed analytical reports:

- **Adaptive_ImmuneSystem_LearningReport.md**  
- **Full_Scale_Attack_Simulation_AdaptiveCore.md**  
- **Full_Scale_Attack_Simulation_v2.md**  

These documents show how the immune system:
- learns  
- adapts  
- reinforces memory  
- responds faster under repeated attack  

---

## 7. Additional Documentation

All high‑level and developer‑focused docs are stored in `docs/reports/`:

- **AdaptiveCore_CodeBlueprint_v2.md**  
- **AdaptiveCore_DeveloperGuide_v2.md**  
- **AdaptiveCore_TechSpec_v2.md**  
- **AdaptiveCore_Whitepaper_v2.md**  

These provide:
- architecture overview  
- module responsibilities  
- API usage  
- integration examples  
- technical specifications  

---

## 8. Integration Readiness

The Adaptive Core is **complete for v2** and ready for:

- standalone simulation  
- full‑shield orchestration  
- DigiByte testnet integration  
- PQC‑aware memory evolution in future versions  

It is the sixth and final layer required before the full merged **DigiByte Quantum Immune Shield** repository is assembled.
