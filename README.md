## 1. Purpose of the Adaptive Core
The Adaptive Core is the **immune system** of the entire DigiByte Quantum Shield architecture.  
While the 5 primary layers (Sentinel AI v2, DQSN v2, ADN v2, Guardian Wallet v2, QWG v2) provide detection, confirmation, defense, and wallet safety…  
**the Adaptive Core learns.**

It continuously:
- observes high‑risk patterns  
- stores threat memory  
- reinforces known signatures  
- evolves new signatures  
- sends immune alerts back to all layers  

This allows DigiByte to *get stronger after every attack*.

## 2. Core Components

### 🧠 2.1 Pattern Engine
Learns attack sequences, emerging anomalies, repeated patterns.

### 🗂 2.2 Threat Memory
Stores condensed “threat packets” describing previous high‑risk events.

### ✏️ 2.3 Memory Writer
Writes threat packets into long‑term memory and performs pruning rules.

### 🔌 2.4 Interface Layer
The external API for the other 5 layers to communicate with the Adaptive Core.

### ⚙️ 2.5 Engine
Coordinates memory, pattern logic, scoring and produces an **Immune Response Packet**.

## 3. What the Adaptive Core Learns

The system incrementally learns:

- UTXO cluster anomalies  
- Time‑compressed activity bursts  
- Dormant key sweeps  
- Multi‑layer correlated risk  
- Behavioural anomalies  
- Rare or new unseen attack sequences  
- Network‑level cross‑signals from DQSN  
- Node‑level reflex triggers from ADN  
- Wallet‑level behaviour changes (GW + QWG)

This produces a **Network Immune Score (NIS)** and an **Immune Severity Level**.

## 4. Data Flow

```
[Sentinel AI] →  
    signal packets (entropy drops, reorg patterns)
        ↓
[DQSN] →  
    global confirmation + cluster scoring
        ↓
[ADN v2] →  
    defensive events (lockdown, API throttling)
        ↓
[Wallet Layers] →  
    behavioural + quantum signatures
        ↓
[Adaptive Core] →  
    learn → store → evolve → return immune packet
```

Each loop makes the shield stronger.
